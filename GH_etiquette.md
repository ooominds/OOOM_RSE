# Github etiquette

## Opening issues
There are multiple situations in which you might want to open an issue:
- to report an error you need help with
- discuss a high-level topic or idea (e.g. policies, community)
- propose a new feature or idea

## Making a pull request
Let's say you found a bug in someone else's code or have been asked to contribute to a project. Here's how you can submit your pull request with confidence.

### Be clear and specific
There is a comment box for a reason, you should type in the following information there:
- explain what the problem is and how your changes fix this
- if your PR solves an open issue make sure you reference this
- have screenshots to show the tests/improvements? Add them

## Keep changes small
if you have found 5 bugs and were determined to fix them all consider making separate PR for each of this.
This will allow the repository owner to deal with the PR quicker and more efficiently.

## Receiving a pull request
You might also be on the other side of the PR.
Sometimes when having open repositories we receive unexpected PRs.
Make sure you remember this:
- don't be rude
- don't fix their mistakes... shall you find that their proposed solution does not help or cause additional issues explain this to the author


Also make sure you read [GitHub user guide to project contribution](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
