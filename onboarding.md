# Onboarding for OOOminders

This is your jumping point to get you up and running with your computational work as an OOOminder.

(Please note that this is still a work in progress and you can help to make this a better onboarding experience for those that come after you!)

This repository contains some resources and will help us to keep track of the work being developed as part of the project. It will as well, serve as the main point of technical contact between you and your RSE.

Don't worry if I have already used loads of words you have never heard before... you will get familiar with all of this sooner than you think.


## Getting you up and running
You will be needing a lot of software to be installed... we tried to gather a sensible amount of resources that will get you going for now.

### Site licensed software

The main point of access to get licensed software as a PhD student or staff at the university of Sheffield is via the [CiCS software website](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/software/).

Head there and request the following software:
- MATLAB
- Intel Parallel Studio XE Composer

Make sure you are logged into your MUSE account first.

Once you have done this head to [https://www.visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com) and get the Visual Studio community edition (Make sure you get the community edition or you'll have to pay for this!!!)

### Open Source software
We will also need you to install the following open source software:

- **Git** is what we will be using for version control for all the software we will develop over the course of this project. So go to [the git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and get it installed on your computer.
- You will need a text editor as well. We recommend [Atom ](https://atom.io) as this integrates really well with Git and is a rather flexible and customisable editor. If you prefer any other (Notepad ++, vim, sublime) go ahead and make sure you have this installed.
- **Anaconda**: [Anaconda ](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/) is a flexible easy-to-install package manager, environment manager and Python distribution.
- **R and RStudio**: get the latest R version from [here](https://www.r-project.org) and RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com).


## Following steps
Some other things that you will need to do:

- Dust off your command line skills: we have a mini(really mini) tutorial on the  command line. Feel free to head [here](https://github.com/mikecroucher/Intro_to_HPC/blob/gh-pages/terminal_tutorial.md) and have a look at this.

Not feeling super confident using the command line or are you a very visual person (like [Tania](https://github.com/trallard))?

 Consider using a GUI client for your version control tasks.
My favourite is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com). Although others prefer [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

You can use a mixture of GUI and command line for your workflow... writing good software and following best practices should not be overcomplicated, but it takes practice and loads of (just like science right?).

- You will be required to attend a RSE workshop/induction in the next couple of weeks, make sure to check the project google calendar for the full details.


Induction                                                        | Facilitator  | Date     |

- Get a GitHub account at [ https://github.com](https://github.com)
  - **PhDs**: you might want to apply for a [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). It comes with loads of cool tools for software development (including free TravisCI for your projects)
  - **RAs**: you cannot get a student's account but you can get a get a discount [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new) and this will allow you to have free private repositories

## Some useful resources
If you want to refresh some of your skills before your upcoming induction session feel free to visit the following resources:

- [Ten simple rules for taking advantage of Git and GitHub](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004947)
- [Code school Try.git interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
- [Git command line cheatsheet](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
- [Git glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)

If you have identified any other awesome and useful resources that you want to share with the team please add them here!


**Important**: if you feel you need additional training or are struggling with your software do not hesitate and approach your RSE, she/he will be happy to discuss this with you and point you in the right direction
