# Out of Our Minds - Research Software Engineering

This repository contains all the RSE related tasks for the Out of Our Minds project.

Your assigned RSEs for this project are:

- Tania Allard, PhD ([trallard](https://github.com/trallard))
- Mike Croucher, PhD ([mikecroucher](https://github.com/mikecroucher))

Feel free to contact them for software development queries.

## GitHub as a central tool for our project

As you have noticed all of this information is stored in a repository within GitHub. (_If you are not familiar with git or any other version control tools don't panic._)

 For now think of it as a project folder which contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history... which will avoid this horrible situation *evryone* has faced

 We will use git and GitHub along with **all** the pieces of software that will be developed as part of the OOOminds project.

 Make sure to keep your repositories/issues up to date. Push and pull regularly and frequently.

## What do you mean by *ALL* the pieces of software?
Git will be your version control tool, meaning it will help you keep track of your scripts and other types of objects as well as of their _evolution_.

Hence, your code does not need to be perfect or completed before being added to a repository. In fact we think you'd benefit more from adding all your scripts to the main OOOminds repository... from _dummy_ scripts to _production ready_ code.

## On the repositories' visibility
The content of this repository is completely public. This is done to ensure communication and collaboration among the various members  included in the project.

If for any reasons your work has to be kept _private_ during development phases or to comply with collaborators' and funding bodies requirements please contact your RSE to discuss this topic.

## Onboarding
New members should start by reading the [onboarding file](./onboarding.md) in this repository.

This file contains information on the tasks you need to complete over the first few weeks into the project (software related).

## GitHub etiquette
We know some of you are experienced git/GitHub users while others have never heard of this before.
Make sure you visit the [GitHub etiquette section](./GH_etiquette.md) before getting started.
